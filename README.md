# DatZ1031-LV-1st-homework

The submission deadline is 21 October 2022.

There are two tasks in your homework:

Find out, what Bootstrap means, skip through its documentation, which can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/
Using Bootstrap, convert the given document into a valid HTML that is visually as close to the example as possible. 
Downloads are attached to the task

The source document / visual example (created using Mozilla Firefox)
index.html mock-up
File with texts used in the document
Convert the given document into a valid HTML5 code. Use as many HTML elements as you can find in the document (especially HTML5). As a minimum, you should be able to find the following: paragraph, heading, image, iframe (use it for embedding Youtube video), code, lists (unordered and description lists), mark, em, strong, blockquote, etc. 

Do not use CSS explicitly in this homework (do not use STYLE element or style attribute of other elements), find appropriate Bootstrap classes instead. Explicit CSS code will not be graded in this task.

The navigation menu must look as it is displayed in the example picture. It is not required to change the active menu item when a user selects any menu item other than "What is JavaScript?", i.e. "What is JavaScript?" may remain active all the time.  

Before you submit, check the validity of your document using W3C validator: http://validator.w3.org


You should submit only an HTML file, rename it to your student ID number + .html extension (e.g. sd12345.html)


Additional useful information about the document

The navigation bar on the right consists of in-page hyperlinks to the respective sections of the document (assign IDs to section headers, make links to each section).  
Use Bootstrap grid (rows and columns) to define the desired layout (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/).
The blue texts in the document are hyperlinks. "ECMA-262 Specification" is a hyperlink to https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/. "http://www.ecmascript.org" is a hyperlink to http://www.ecmascript.org. "YouTube" is a hyperlink to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk
URL of the picture used in the document is: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png/600px-JavaScript-logo.png
The video is embedded from the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk
You must replace [put your name here] and [put current date and time here] in the last line with your data preserving formatting (light yellow background). Use the corresponding element to get the desired formatting.
